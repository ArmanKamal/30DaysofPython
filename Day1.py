### Python is a dynamic language not statically type as you dont need to declare any variable before using them ###

### There are two kinds of numbers in python 1.Integer 2.Float ###

### Example of integer number ###

int1 = 7
print(int1) ## This will print 7 in the output  ##


## Example of float number ##

float1 = 7.0
print(float1) ## So as you can see the decimal number is the float number ##


## So we can do some Addtion & Substraction & Multiplication & Division & Remainder & expotential ##

a = 6
b = 4

add = a+b
sub = a-b
mul = a*b
div = a/b
mod = a%b
expo = a**b

print(add)
print(sub)
print(mul)
print(div)
print(mod)
print(expo)


### Now string is number of characters  ###

name = 'Arman'
print(name)


### If you multiply name by any number you will duplicate it many times ###
print(name*5)

### Now you cannot add int with string as they are not same kind of data types ###

### The result that where we are  storing  are known as variables . you can easily store anything so that you can use it anywhere later###

### Like the previous name variable contains a string so we can again re use it here ###
print(name+' You are back again')


### SO there you have it your day1 is done ###

### Happy coding ###
